## ⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Sustainability

```
❌ Don't: Run 0% forever
✅ Do: Plan transition to sustainable fees
```

### 2. Communication

```
❌ Don't: Surprise users with sudden fees
✅ Do: Announce fee changes in advance (30 days notice)
```

### 3. Grandfathering

```
Consider: 
- Early sellers get permanent lower fee (3% vs 5%)
- Reward early adopters
- Build loyalty
```

### 4. Volume Discounts

```
Tiered Fees:
- 0-50 orders/month: 5%
- 51-100 orders/month: 4%
- 100+ orders/month: 3%

Incentivize high-volume sellers
```

### 5. Payment Flow

**Important:** Even at 0% fee, the payment calculation still works:

```php
$platformFee = $totalAmount * (0 / 100);  // = 0
$sellerAmount = $totalAmount - $platformFee;  // = $totalAmount
```

No code changes needed! Just set fee to 0%.
